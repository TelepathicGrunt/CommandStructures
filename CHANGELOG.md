## **(V.4.3.0 Changes) (1.20.4 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Updated to 1.20.4

##### Commands: 
Added `/fillstructurevoid <size>` command that will fill a sphere outward from where you're standing replacing air with structure void. 
 It does so by recursively spreading out, so it won't replace air inside house or enclosed spaces. 
 Good for filling outside of houses with structure void in a quick and dirty way.
 Used best with Structure Void Toggle mod.
